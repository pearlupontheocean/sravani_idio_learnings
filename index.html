<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We were asked to answer a few questions such as </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>How has work evolved?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>What are the challenges at work?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>What do you expect from work life?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>What do employers expect?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>How should the IDIO classes be?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We had never been asked these questions before for any other
course. Thus, the class instantly piques interest in IDIO.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We were subtly introduced to the total course curriculum. At
the end of the class discussion, we concluded that any living human being must
have a&nbsp;<i>meaning and purpose</i>&nbsp;to his or her life, and the factors
that empower us in that journey are:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>

</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The most effective people are those who can hold their
vision while remaining committed to seeing current reality clearly<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Flow:<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the class, we discussed about flow. The concept of <i>Flow</i>,
as defined by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, offers profound insights into the
psychology of optimal performance. It encapsulates the experience of being
fully immersed in an activity, resulting in heightened focus and an altered
sense of time. I believe we are fully at ease and fully present when we are in
the flow state. <b><o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But I dont think achieving the flow state fully is
practically possible in chaotic workplace settings. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>I feel that while Flow emphasizes individual experience,
it often overlooks social and collective dimensions of engagement, which are
critical in team-oriented settings.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A video of&nbsp;<b>Mohini Dey</b>, a musician was shown. She
was so engrossed in playing her instrument that she was oblivious to her
environment. The act and her became one thing. A state of flow entails the
following characteristics:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l19 level1 lfo8;tab-stops:list 36.0pt'>Focus</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l19 level1 lfo8;tab-stops:list 36.0pt'>Timelessness</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l19 level1 lfo8;tab-stops:list 36.0pt'>The
     state of being one with the act</li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal>Being a singer myself, the concept of flow was very near to
heart and I felt that I understood the concept intuitively rather than
theoretically. Once I start singing, I forget about my immediate surroundings
because there is a more important task at hand  to deliver a good performance.
But once I start focusing on the notes, I forget about the performance itself. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Attitude of Perfection &amp; Excellence:<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An attitude of perfection fosters excellence, attention to
detail, and a commitment to delivering the best results. It drives continuous
improvement, builds credibility, and inspires others, ensuring high-quality
outcomes in both personal and professional endeavors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Synergy &amp; Harmony:<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Synergy magnifies collective efforts, creating outcomes
greater than individual contributions, while harmony ensures seamless
coexistence and mutual respect, fostering an environment of unity and
productivity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:107%'>What is
my personality type?<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another day of excitement continued when we were introduced
to the concept of Personality. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>IDIO classes are always something to look forward because
each class incorporates a new way of teaching. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a well-known
personality assessment tool.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It evaluates personality based on four dichotomies:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l0 level2 lfo4;tab-stops:list 72.0pt'>Introversion
      (I) vs. Extraversion (E)</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l0 level2 lfo4;tab-stops:list 72.0pt'>Sensing
      (S) vs. Intuition (N)</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l0 level2 lfo4;tab-stops:list 72.0pt'>Thinking
      (T) vs. Feeling (F)</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l0 level2 lfo4;tab-stops:list 72.0pt'>Judging
      (J) vs. Perceiving (P)</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>The MBTI was first developed in the 1940s by Isabel Briggs
Myers and Katharine Cook Briggs, inspired by Carl Jungs theory of psychological
types.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Personal Experience:<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I took the MBTI test to explore how a series of simple
questions across various aspects of life could define ones personality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While taking the test, I aimed to answer each question
honestly and reflected on how the test results might align with my
understanding of my personality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I realised that my personality type is INTJ.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I consider myself more introverted than extroverted and
thats exactly what the test showed as well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The test has helped me realise the inherent traits I
possess. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the class, Viji Maam wanted to understand the
demographics of all students who had taken the test. She first asked how many
students have at least 40% or above on the extroversion-introversion scale. I
believe a more comprehensive analysis of personality is necessary before
fitting a persons personality type into a mould. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Later, maam made those students who have at least 50% on
other scales perform activities such as role-play, etc. One of my friends took
part in the role-play. She had scored high on the feelings index. So when she
had to take a decision in the role-play, everyone had expected her to be swayed
by her emotions. But surprisingly, she didnt let her feelings influence her
decision-making in a professional setting. It was fascinating to see that even
though my friend had scored high on the feelings index, she maintains a
distinction between personal and professional life. <b>One of the key takeaways
from this discussion was about maintaining boundaries between personal and
professional life.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The main learning for me was that some traits could be
natural to me, but I can switch to my other traits as well when need be.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We went through <b>Susan Cains Ted Talk</b>. That was an
eye-opener. For someone like me who is more of an introvert than an extrovert,
the video was a testament that it was okay to be introverted. That, in fact,
being introverted is powerful in its own way. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The word Harmony  immediately reminds me of the <b>Sister
Act Harmony Synergy</b> video that we watched in class. A new conductor for
music was brought in and we find that the choir , which was originally singing
off key, can now sing in perfect pitch. They even go on to try out a different
genre of music than they were used to. Being a singer myself, I know how
important harmony is in singing. But seeing that concept explained so
succinctly and in a group setting with a choir made me think about the
implications of harmony in an organisational setting. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Synergy is essential in an organizational setting because it
leverages the collective strengths, skills, and perspectives of employees to
achieve goals more efficiently. It fosters innovation by encouraging
collaboration and idea-sharing, enhances productivity through aligned teamwork,
and promotes a unified culture. Synergy enables organizations to solve complex
problems and deliver results that exceed individual capabilities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Ikigai: Japanese secret to long and happy life<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ikigai is a Japanese concept that translates to &quot;a
reason for being&quot; or &quot;a reason to wake up in the morning.&quot; It is
often depicted as the intersection of four core elements:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l2 level1 lfo19;tab-stops:list 36.0pt'>What
     You Love (Your Passion): Things you truly enjoy and are passionate about.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l2 level1 lfo19;tab-stops:list 36.0pt'>What
     You Are Good At (Your Vocation): Skills and talents that you excel in or
     are capable of mastering.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l2 level1 lfo19;tab-stops:list 36.0pt'>What
     the World Needs (Your Mission): How your actions, talents, or
     contributions help society or make the world a better place.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l2 level1 lfo19;tab-stops:list 36.0pt'>What
     You Can Be Paid For (Your Profession): The ability to make a living from
     what you do.</li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal>When all these elements align, the result is a fulfilling
and meaningful life, where work, personal values, and societal needs intersect.
Ikigai is not just about professional success but also personal happiness and
societal contribution. In Japanese culture, its often seen as a source of
purpose that leads to greater satisfaction and longevity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For individuals, it is about finding that sweet spot where
personal fulfillment meets external impact, leading to a sense of balance and
satisfaction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Ladder of Inference is a powerful tool for improving
decision-making and communication. It highlights how people move from observing
facts to taking actions based on assumptions and beliefs, often unconsciously.
By understanding its steps, we can identify biases, question our reasoning, and
avoid jumping to conclusions. This awareness promotes better collaboration by
encouraging openness to other perspectives. Using the ladder consciously helps
in resolving conflicts, fostering critical thinking, and making more rational,
informed decisions in both personal and professional context.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I had a question in my RBS assignment that asked suggestions
for areas I could improve myself in. The Johari window technique was useful in
this aspect.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The <b>Johari Window</b> is a psychological tool that helps
improve self-awareness, mutual understanding, and communication in
interpersonal relationships. It is particularly useful in team settings,
personal development, and leadership training. It consists of four quadrants
that represent different aspects of our personality:&nbsp;<b>open, blind,
hidden, and unknown</b>. By utilizing the Johari window, I can gain insight
into my own strengths and weaknesses, as well as better understand how others
perceive me. This knowledge would allow me to communicate more effectively and
build stronger connections with my team members.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I find the Johari window a useful tool to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Promote Team Cohesion:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l3 level1 lfo10;tab-stops:list 36.0pt'>Teams

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Kintsugi</b>:<br>
During the discussion, we explored the <b>Japanese philosophy of <i>Kintsugi</i></b><i>,</i>
which teaches us to celebrate imperfections. This philosophy reminds us that,
as humans, flaws are inevitablewhether in our appearance, character, or
actions. <b>Embracing these imperfections and learning from them can lead to
profound personal growth.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Vulnerability:<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We delved into the concept of vulnerability, a term
frequently associated with weakness. However, I see vulnerability as a vital
human emotion that must be embraced. Recognizing that everyone is susceptible
to something and making peace with it is a rare skill, yet one that fosters
growth and empathy. <b>Expressing vulnerability is important</b>. It can be as
simple as asking for help when needed. These expressions are not signs of
weakness but of courage, self-awareness, and authenticity. Understanding and
accepting vulnerability in ourselves and others can create an environment of
trust and compassion, both personally and professionally.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:107%'><br>
Building authenticity:<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I believe that building authenticity is the single most
important thing in this fast-evolving world. Originality is much sought after.
Authenticity fosters creativity, innovation, critical thinking and builds
confidence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:107%'>The Moral
and Ethical Compass:<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In class, we did an activity where we were told we would be
doing a surprise quiz. Question papers and answer sheets were handed out. Viji
maam went outside during the class. She came back after some time and asked us
to wrap up the test. Some students had opened their phones and cheated in the
absence of maam. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A discussion ensued in the class after this activity.
Everyone pitched in with their ideas about ethics. The concepts of right and
wrong often feel straightforward, yet they remain deeply nuanced and subject to
interpretation. To truly discern between the two, it is essential to understand
the distinction between morals and ethics. While ethics are external guidelines
provided by institutions, workplaces, or religious frameworks, morals are
internal principles shaped by individual experiences and beliefs. This
distinction helps us navigate the complexities of life, where our choices often
alignor conflictwith societal expectations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reflecting on my own life, I have encountered moments where
my decisions clashed with common societal norms. We must cultivate
open-mindedness, allowing us to appreciate diverse viewpoints and recognize the
humanity in others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In another class session, we watched two videos about <b>Lance
Armstrong</b>, the renowned cyclist who won the Tour de France seven times.
Armstrongs confession to doping on live television was an act of vulnerability
and honesty. In a second video, his statement that he would make the same
choices if given another chance was unsettling. This contradiction underscores
the crucial role ethics play in our lives. His lack of remorse reflects a
disregard for ethical principles, raising questions about accountability and
integrity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ethics guide us in making decisions that impact not only
ourselves but also those around us. Living ethically involves taking
responsibility for our actions and striving to align our behavior with
universal principles of fairness and respect. Those who are unethical may find
themselves haunted by guilt, unable to reconcile their actions with their
conscience.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ultimately, <b>the journey to understanding right and wrong
is not a straight path</b>. It is a grey area. It requires <b>introspection, a
willingness to learn from our imperfections and the courage to learn</b>. By
embracing these values, we can navigate lifes moral dilemmas with greater
clarity, compassion, and purpose.</p>

<b><span style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:107%'>Intrinsic motivation:
Becoming a self-actualizing individual:<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Self-Actualization and Motivation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Self-actualization is a concept rooted in psychology,
famously introduced by Abraham Maslow in his <i>Hierarchy of Needs</i>. It
represents the highest level of psychological development, where individuals
strive to realize their full potential, talents, and capabilities.
Self-actualization is often seen as the ultimate goal of personal growth,
encompassing creativity, fulfillment, and the pursuit of meaningful goals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The Role of Motivation in Self-Actualization<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Motivation is the driving force behind human behavior and
plays a pivotal role in achieving self-actualization. According to Maslow's
theory, motivation operates on a hierarchy, starting with basic physiological
needs (e.g., food, water) and progressing to safety, love and belonging,
esteem, and finally self-actualization. <b>This progression highlights that
self-actualization is achieved only when more fundamental needs are met</b>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An important theory here is the <b>Cognitive Evaluation
Theory of Motivation</b>. It is a theory in psychology that is designed to
explain the effects of external consequences on internal motivation. The theory
suggests that there are two motivation systems;&nbsp;<i>intrinsic&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>extrinsic&nbsp;</i>which
correspond to two kinds of motivators. Intrinsic motivators can be achievement,
responsibility, and competence  motivators that come from the actual
performance of the task or job. Extrinsic motivators can be pay, promotion,
feedback, and working conditions  things that come from a persons
environment, controlled by others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Systems Thinking:<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>System 1 and System 2 represent two modes of thinking.
System 1 is fast, intuitive, and automatic, handling routine decisions
effortlessly but prone to biases. System 2 is slow, analytical, and deliberate,
used for complex reasoning and problem-solving. Together, they complement each
other, balancing efficiency and rationality in decision-making.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The outbound activity was such a fun and memorable activity!
I was in a team with a bunch of people I had never teamed up with thus far. We
played various games. In the first three games, we were all pitted against one
another in teams. So there was always the factor of wanting to outperform the
other teams. The last game was especially interesting as all the four teams we
had to complete the game by<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>coordinating
with one another. So we were trying to achieve the end goal together. We were
asked to remain silent during the entirety of the last game. That emphasised

<p class=MsoNormal>The <b>Six Thinking Hats</b> is a decision-making and

making:<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The simulation decision making was interesting in itself. I
was teamed up with two of my classmates for this activity. What made this
activity particularly fun was that we were responsible for the high-level
decision making of a medical equipment manufacturing company. I have never been
responsible for a high-stakes decision before. So this environment was new. I
felt powerful. There were multiple aspects that had to be taken into
consideration during this activity. The text messages, emails and the videos
are provided information of varying importance and from various perspectives.
We are well versed with the proverb: Too many cooks spoil the broth. But this
activity made me think about the proverb. Do too many cooks really spoil the
broth? The answer is yes, if we are indeed making a broth. But what if its an
organisation where the decision will affect tens of thousands of employees?
Then maybe the answer is no. A detailed investigation by different people will
definitely help. When I found myself responsible for taking the decision of whether
or not to go ahead with a decision that would impact the entire company, I
needed others advice in doing so.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The case:<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The development of the new medical device has encountered
several challenges, including high costs and a three-year timeline, compounded
by a change in the supplier for the microprocessor. While this new supplier
promises a 15% improvement rather than the expected 20%, the product faces
ongoing quality issues, particularly concerning faulty internal components and
unclear instructions for use. These issues have led to consumer misuse, a major
concern highlighted by multiple stakeholders involved in the project.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kurt, the Director of Consumer Insights, along with Nick and
Dr.Greg Young, pointed out that users often struggle with the correct use of
the device, especially when it comes to inserting the test strip. Testing
conducted on a small sample of just 156 people, most of whom had limited
educational backgrounds, showed that many users were initially confused about
how to properly use the device. However, when provided with clear instructions,
especially from medical practitioners, 55% of the users reported feeling more
confident about their ability to use the device correctly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dr. Sandy Powers raised concerns that the issues could stem
from consumer misuse, particularly among elderly individuals who might not
follow the instructions as intended. Nurses also noted improper use, including
incorrect insertion of the test strips, further highlighting the need for
better guidance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To address these concerns, Walter Jackson, Chairman of the
Board, approved a substantial expenditure of $1 million to ensure the device is
used properly. This investment is intended to improve consumer understanding
and reduce errors in usage, ensuring the device performs as intended and meets
the expected standards of quality and safety. The ultimate goal is to enhance
user experience, minimize misuse, and ensure the device fulfills its intended
purpose effectively.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Ethics, Intuition, and Leadership:<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ethics form the foundation of our soul. To compromise them
is to risk losing oneself. Preserving integrity ensures alignment between
vision and goals. Leaders today must not only think critically but also
collaborate effectively, fostering environments where employees leave more
skilled and enriched than when they arrived.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's essential to maintain interests outside work, ones that
are both meaningful and affordable. Life demands belief in intuitiona domain
where inner clarity arises spontaneously. <b>Intuition</b> manifests through the
sudden resolution of confusion, the natural falling into place of unclear
ideas, and a spontaneous sense of resonance and joy. These moments, often
marked by an &quot;aha,&quot; signal the power of intuitive understanding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, such clarity often invites fear, a reaction to
stepping into the unknown. True leadership lies in recognizing and overcoming
this fear, embracing ethical action, and guiding others with a balance of
reason and intuition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Resilience, Leadership, and Reinvention<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Uncertainty is the only certainty in life, yet weve proven
our resilience by surviving challenges like COVID-19. This shared experience
has instilled grit, determination, and the understanding that we are never
truly alone. While our purpose may shift over time, its important to remember
that setbacks, such as not landing a job, arent the end of the world. Hope
lies in perseverance, in continuing to &quot;just keep swimming.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>True leadership lies in inspiring others and being a person
who is not only skilled but also likable and empathetic. Leadership thrives on
understanding, perception, and networking, built upon the narrative we craft
about ourselves. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amid lifes endless stimuli, it is vital to cultivate habits
that promote mental and physical well-being. Watch, read, and engage in things
that uplift and inspire us. We need to learn to consciously engage and
disengage, focusing on what truly matters. Your words hold immense powerthey
are your strongest wand. Use them wisely. Hope is the bridge to a brighter
tomorrow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Good sleep is essential for maintaining mental clarity,
allowing us to listen attentively, think critically, and communicate
effectively. Speaking and writing with clarity are key to conveying ideas and
ensuring that messages are understood. It's important to take the time to read
and review what weve written, as this helps identify areas for improvement and
ensures precision.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In any workplace that values quality and innovation, its
essential to strike a balance with incentives. While incentives can motivate
employees, they may sometimes work against the organizations long-term goals
if they are not aligned with the companys values. The focus should be on
fostering a culture of collaboration, creativity, and continuous improvement.
By encouraging clear thinking and communication, and by carefully structuring
incentives, organizations can enhance both individual performance and overall
organizational success.</p>
